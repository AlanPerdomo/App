# 1 - Install Dependencies (if needed for the first time):
    Run the command 'npm i' in your project directory. This command will install the required dependencies listed in your project's package.json file. You usually only need to do this the first time you set up the project or if there are changes to the dependencies.

# 2 - Start the Expo Development Server:
    Run the command 'npx expo start' in your project directory. This command will start the Expo development server. Expo will open a web page in your browser with a QR code that you can scan using the Expo Go app on your mobile device. This will allow you to preview and test your React Native app on your actual device.
